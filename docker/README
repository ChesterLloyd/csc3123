Build a docker container:

    docker build -t framework .

Then you can run it :

    docker run -d -p 80:80 -v PATH-TO-PARENT:/var/www/html -v PATH-TO-PARENT/docker/db:/var/lib/mysql framework

where PATH-TO-PARENT is the full path to the parent of this directory.

First go to

    http://localhost/install.php
    
and fill in the form. Use the database name framework, with user and password also framework.

Your system should now be up and running. You can edit and create files in yoru directory and they wil be
visible in your docker container.
